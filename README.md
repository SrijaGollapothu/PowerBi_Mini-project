# PowerBi_Mini-project
This Power BI Dashboard is all about managing healthcare data related to patient wait lists, including information on both inpatient and outpatient categories. Here's how we go about creating it:
1. Gathering Information: We start by collecting all the necessary details about patient wait lists.
2. Setting Objectives: We decide what we want to achieve with the dashboard once we have all the information.
3. Collecting Data: Next, we gather the actual data needed to build the dashboard.
4. Connecting Data: We link this data to Power BI so we can work with it effectively.
5. Transforming and Modeling: We clean up and organize the data in Power BI to make it easier to analyze.
6. Designing Visuals: We plan out how we want the data to be displayed in the dashboard.
7. Creating the Dashboard Layout: We then arrange everything in Power BI to make a clear and easy-to-understand dashboard.
8. Making it Look Good and Interactive: Finally, we add some creative touches to make the dashboard visually appealing and interactive for users.
This process helps us create a useful and user-friendly tool for managing and understanding patient wait list data in healthcare.
